intro:
  heading: Agchem
  description: "Agrochemicals are formulated as emulsions, suspensions,
    microemulsions, and various controlled-release systems. Control of the
    interaction forces between the droplets or particles is essential in
    achieving the long-term physical stability of the formulation as well as
    optimum application. Various interaction forces must be considered:
    attractive van der Waals, repulsive electrostatic, or steric forces.
    Combination of these interaction forces results in various energy-distance
    curves that determine the state of the system on storage. It is necessary to
    control the various processes such as creaming or sedimentation,
    flocculation, Ostwald ripening, coalescence, and phase inversions. "
